## Introduction  

In this repo I'm studying the different interactions between Google Maps Platform APIs. The first iteration consist of a base map using the Google JavaScript API and from there I am adding additional services.

It also served as a way to learn how to migrate from legacy markers which was used initially to the new Advanced Markers. Comments have been added in the main.js file indicating were the changes were made.

## Design  

The project will be upgraded in a modular approach integrating new aspects of the Google Maps APIs on each iteration. For details on this topic please check the version history section.
